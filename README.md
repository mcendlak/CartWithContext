# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Running the project for development purposes:
1. Run the json-server with this command:
`json-server --watch data/data.json`
  This will run the server on `localhost:3000` by default.
2. Then open another terminal and run:
`npm start`
  Since `localhost:3000` is already occupied by json-server, you will have to accept to run the app on another port by typing `y`
