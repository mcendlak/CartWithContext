# Cart with reducer and context API

#### React.js + TypeScript

The purpose of this assignment was to practice the use of useContext and useReducer hooks

## Running the project

1. In the project directory, install all the packages with the command:
   `npm install`
2. Run the json-server with this command:
   `json-server --watch data/data.json`
   This will run the server on `localhost:3000` by default.
3. Then open another terminal and run:
   `npm start`
   Since `localhost:3000` is already occupied by json-server, you will have to accept to run the app on another port by typing `y`
